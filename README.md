Abstract:
Automotive vehicles become smarter and more connected every year. Numerous
interaction interfaces, proprietary implementations and lacking security mechanisms
for ECUs and internal networks build up an attack surface that makes vehicles an
appealing target for adversaries and researchers. In the last two decades, severe
misconfigurations and vulnerabilities have been uncovered. With millions of sold
vehicles every year, it is necessary to continue this research to raise awareness for
vehicle security and to encourage the automotive industry to mitigate discovered issues
and also to implement better in-vehicle security.
In the first chapter, the vulnerability of modern vehicles to hacking is pointed out and
the main objectives of the thesis are defined. The next chapter examines, which
networks can be found inside modern vehicles such as CAN or FlexRay and what
kinds of message formats and protocols they use. In the third chapter, an overview of
previous research about car hacking, wireless interfaces, IVIs and the Android OS is
given. This is followed by an analysis of vehicle input interfaces that form a significant
attack surface, as well as common security threats for them. For each interface,
security mechanisms, access difficulty and possible attacks are determined, and an
access range categorization is made afterwards. Chapter five consists of a case study
that utilizes known vulnerabilities in the Android OS to acquire root access on a
smartphone as well as an IVI. Furthermore, it demonstrates how a compromised
Android device can be abused in multiple ways to access vehicle internal networks.
This thesis shows that communication inside vehicles gravely lacks security measures
and the growing number of connectivity options results in more and more entry points
for adversaries. Moreover, it shows that it is possible to access internal vehicle
networks through a compromised IVI and how the Android OS can be abused to
achieve this result. In addition, the thesis points out the necessity of mitigation
mechanisms such as over-the-air-updates for security incidents in vehicles and that the
automotive industry has to put more effort into securing its products.
